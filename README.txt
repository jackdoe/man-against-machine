got kind of sick of youtube recommending inappropriate videos to my 5yo daughter,
so i will whitelist some until she can type youtube.com on hhkb2-blan

so at the moment it is pretty much:
    add(v, 5, 'L0MK7qz13bU', 'frozen');
    add(v, 5, 'hSQxjB1Jdkw', 'finger song');
    add(v, 5, 'u9zAJz2wyG8', 'peppa');

it shuffles the videos on load, and then just iterates through the shuffled list
more videos will be added soon, but of course pull requests will be merged quickly

to use, just go to:
